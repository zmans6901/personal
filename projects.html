        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>The first project I want to talk about is my java disassembler, I completed this project for a class about assembly.
            This project was difficult because we had to write it all in assembly, which makes it 100x harder to do anything than a regular
            language. I think it's a note worthy project because disassemblers are still used today and neccesary for computers to function properly.
        </p>
        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p>The second project is a project I made during my internship was made with C#. It was my first time using C# because there are no
            C# classes here at Iowa State (that I know of) and I can't say too much because company secrets but I automated a process that had to be 
            done manually before the project.
